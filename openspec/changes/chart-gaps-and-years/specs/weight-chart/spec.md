## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Weight chart
Historia SHALL show, above the weight list, a chart of the weights this app wrote (scale, manual and
imported) in the chosen period: each weight as a dot, joined by a line in time order. Where two
consecutive weights are more than 30 days apart the line SHALL break, so a time without weights is
not drawn as a weight; a weight with such a gap on both sides SHALL show as a dot even when the chart
otherwise leaves the dots out. The x-axis labels SHALL show day and month, or month and year when the
chart spans more than a year. Weights written by other apps SHALL NOT be shown.

#### Scenario: A week of weigh-ins
- **GIVEN** the app wrote seven weights in the last seven days
- **WHEN** Historia is shown with period 1 vk
- **THEN** the chart shows seven dots joined by a line, with day labels

#### Scenario: Long gap
- **GIVEN** weights until 20.5.2024 and the next one on 18.3.2025
- **WHEN** Historia is shown with period Kaikki
- **THEN** the line ends at 20.5.2024 and starts again at 18.3.2025, with nothing drawn between

#### Scenario: Lone weight between gaps
- **GIVEN** a single weight in October 2024 with no other weight within 30 days, in a chart dense
  enough to leave the dots out
- **WHEN** the chart is shown
- **THEN** that weight shows as a dot

#### Scenario: Several years
- **GIVEN** weights from 24.9.2022 to today
- **WHEN** Historia is shown with period Kaikki
- **THEN** the x-axis labels read like "9/2022", "7/2023"

#### Scenario: Other app's weight
- **GIVEN** another app wrote a weight yesterday
- **WHEN** the chart is shown
- **THEN** that weight is not in the chart

#### Scenario: No weights in the period
- **WHEN** the chosen period has no weights of this app
- **THEN** the chart area says there are no weights in the period

### Requirement: Point details
Tapping a dot SHALL show that weight's date, time and value; the date SHALL include the year when the
weight is not from the current year.

#### Scenario: Tap a dot
- **WHEN** the user taps the dot of 82.6 kg on 8.11. this year at 7.05
- **THEN** the chart shows "8.11. 7.05 82,6 kg"

#### Scenario: Tap an old dot
- **WHEN** the user taps the dot of 97.6 kg on 15.9.2024 at 8.33
- **THEN** the chart shows "15.9.2024 8.33 97,6 kg"
