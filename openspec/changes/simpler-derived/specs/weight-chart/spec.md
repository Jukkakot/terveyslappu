## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One quantity at a time
Historia's chart and period statistics SHALL show one quantity at a time: Paino or BMI. Tabs with those names SHALL sit above the chart; tapping a tab or swiping the
chart and statistics left or right SHALL switch the quantity, and the chosen period SHALL stay. Both
tabs SHALL always be shown; a quantity that cannot be computed SHALL show, instead of its
chart and statistics, the reason naming the missing owner details and a button to Omat tiedot.
Historia SHALL open on Paino. The weight list under the statistics
SHALL stay the same whatever quantity is shown.

#### Scenario: Swipe to BMI
- **GIVEN** a height is set and Historia shows Paino for 1 kk
- **WHEN** the user swipes the chart to the left
- **THEN** the BMI tab is chosen and the chart and statistics show the BMI of the same 30 days

#### Scenario: No owner details
- **GIVEN** no height is set
- **WHEN** the user opens the BMI tab
- **THEN** it shows "BMI vaatii pituuden" and a button that opens Asetukset at Omat tiedot

#### Scenario: Opens on weight
- **GIVEN** the user left Historia on BMI
- **WHEN** Historia is opened again
- **THEN** it shows Paino

#### Scenario: Tap a tab
- **WHEN** the user taps BMI
- **THEN** the chart and statistics show the BMI of the chosen period

### Requirement: Period statistics
Under the chart the app SHALL show for the chosen period: the latest weight, the change from the
first to the latest weight in kg, that change per week, the average, the lowest and highest weight,
and the number of weights. The change and the change per week SHALL each show a small arrow up for
a gain and down for a loss next to the number, and no arrow when the shown value is zero. For BMI the
statistics SHALL show the same values of the BMI except the change per week; the latest BMI SHALL also show its category word and tone.

#### Scenario: Losing
- **GIVEN** a 1 kk period whose first weight is 83.0 kg and latest 82.0 kg, 28 days apart
- **WHEN** the stats are shown
- **THEN** they show latest 82.0, change −1.0 kg and −0.25 kg/vko, both with an arrow down

#### Scenario: No change
- **GIVEN** a period whose first and latest weight are both 82.0 kg
- **WHEN** the stats are shown
- **THEN** the change shows ±0,0 kg without an arrow

#### Scenario: One weight only
- **WHEN** the period has a single weight
- **THEN** the stats show it as latest, average, lowest and highest and no change or rate

#### Scenario: BMI statistics
- **GIVEN** height 180 cm and a period whose first weight is 83.0 kg and latest 82.0 kg
- **WHEN** the BMI statistics are shown
- **THEN** they show latest 25,3 "ylipaino", change −0,3 with an arrow down, and no rate per week

### Requirement: Units on the chart
The Historia chart's y-axis labels SHALL show the unit (`98 kg`), and every weight and change in
the period statistics SHALL show `kg`. BMI has no unit and its axis labels SHALL be bare numbers under a "BMI" chart title.

#### Scenario: Axis labels
- **WHEN** Historia shows a chart
- **THEN** its y-axis labels read like `96 kg`, `98 kg`

#### Scenario: Statistics
- **WHEN** the period statistics are shown
- **THEN** the latest, average, lowest and highest weight read like `82,0 kg`

#### Scenario: Basal metabolic rate axis
- **WHEN** Historia shows any tab
- **THEN** no axis label or statistic reads `kcal`

### Requirement: Weight scale
Every weight chart (Historia and the home card) SHALL use one y-scale rule: the lowest and highest
shown weight with 0.5 kg room on each side, widened evenly to at least 4 kg when narrower, and
rounded outwards to whole kilos. The scale SHALL grow when the weights spread more and SHALL never be
narrower than 4 kg, so a small change looks small in every period and on both screens. The BMI chart
SHALL use the same rule with the room and the least span as many BMI units as 0.5 kg and 4 kg give
at the owner's height, rounded outwards to whole BMI units.

#### Scenario: Steady weight
- **GIVEN** the weights in view are 97.76 and 97.84 kg
- **THEN** the y-scale runs from 95 to 100 kg and the line looks flat

#### Scenario: Real change
- **GIVEN** the weights in view run from 92.3 to 98.6 kg
- **THEN** the y-scale runs from 91 to 100 kg

#### Scenario: Steady BMI
- **GIVEN** height 180 cm and BMI values in view of 25,2 and 25,3
- **THEN** the BMI y-scale spans at least 1,2 units and the line looks flat

#### Scenario: Steady basal metabolic rate
- **WHEN** Historia is shown
- **THEN** there is no basal metabolic rate chart, only Paino and BMI
