## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Period statistics
Under the chart the app SHALL show for the chosen period: the latest weight, the change from the
first to the latest weight in kg, that change per week, the average, the lowest and highest weight,
and the number of weights. The change and the change per week SHALL each show a small arrow up for
a gain and down for a loss next to the number, and no arrow when the shown value is zero.

#### Scenario: Losing
- **GIVEN** a 1 kk period whose first weight is 83.0 kg and latest 82.0 kg, 28 days apart
- **WHEN** the stats are shown
- **THEN** they show latest 82.0, change −1.0 kg and −0.25 kg/vko, both with an arrow down

#### Scenario: No change
- **GIVEN** a period whose first and latest weight are both 82.0 kg
- **WHEN** the stats are shown
- **THEN** the change shows ±0,0 kg without an arrow

#### Scenario: One weight only
- **WHEN** the period has a single weight
- **THEN** the stats show it as latest, average, lowest and highest and no change or rate
